# Frontend that fetches data from a Django API
This project is a basic frontend that uses API calls to fetch data using a Django API created by me. The API accesses databases and sends data through allowed URLs related to saved projects in the database. The main Django application (Web & API) can be found in my GitHub if you are interested.

This was created based on tutorial videos.
