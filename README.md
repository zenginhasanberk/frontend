# Frontend that fetches data from a Django API
This project is a basic frontend that uses API calls to fetch data using a Django API created by me. The API accesses databases and sends data through allowed URLs related to saved projects in the database. The main.js file makes the API calls and then updates the project-list.html file so that the fetched data is included. The main Django application (Web & API) can be found in my GitHub if you are interested.

This application was created based on tutorial videos made by a [Django programmer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DennisIvy).
